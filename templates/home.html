        <h2>Purpose of this site</h2>
            <p>This site should serve as a portfolio-kinda thing.</p>
            <p>GitHub is a great thing to link to when I'm trying to present myself, but there are two major faults:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GitHub's readme isn't ideal for presenting the project.</li>
                <li>Not every source code can be public</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's why this site exists and why I'd prefer you to read the context :)</p>
